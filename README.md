# Euler Problemset using SAGEMath

This [SAGEmath](https://www.sagemath.org/) (Python) Jupyter practice notebook exists as a portfolio component to demonstrate mastery to employers. Since I'm a big fan of SAGEmath, this is also somewhat of a case study for why SAGEmath make a lot of relatively complex mathematical questions simple to optimize. 

If you are solving the problems for the sake of learning and found yourself here, please read this excerpt from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) page: 
> _There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, that will rarely be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself._

## Why SAGEmath for Project Euler Problems

The approach to these problems focuses on using the appropriate tools to tackle appropriate problems. Since mathematical research software have seen significant optimization in NumPy, SciPy, etc., and C++ packages make things go vroom already, SAGEmath is appropriate because:

0. **Accessibility**: Sagemath is _FOSS_ alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB; designed by and for mathematics researchers, and usable for anyone who knows python.
1. **Ease of Use**:
   - [Linux installation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/linux.html#sec-gnu-linux) is super easy on Linux since Python and TeX come prepackaged in many distros. Windows and Mac simple installation also available too.
   - [Jupyter integration] as demonstrated in this project. 
   - [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/features/sage) allows for collaborative computational work (freemium).
2. **Highly Optimized**: "SageMath allows those students who are more interested in math than `malloc()` to spend more time thinking about math and less time figuring out why their code segfaults."

1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


```python
multiples_of_three_or_five = [x for x in range(1,1000) 
                              if mod(x,3)==0 or mod(x,5)==0]
sum(multiples_of_three_or_five)
```

2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 
   
   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... 
   
   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


```python
evensum = 0
for i in range(1000):
    F = fibonacci(i)
    if F > 4000000:
        break
    if mod(F,2) == 0:
        evensum += F
evensum
```

3. The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

   What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?


```python
factor(600851475143)
```




    71 * 839 * 1471 * 6857



4. A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

   Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


```python
m = 999
n = 999

palindrome_prod = []

while m > 100:
    while n >= m:
        prod = m*n
        if Word(str(prod)).is_palindrome():
            palindrome_prod.append(prod)
        n -= 1
    m -= 1
    n = 999

print(max(palindrome_prod))
```

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


```python
lcm(range(1,21))
```

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


```python
sum(range(1,101))^2 - sum([x^2 for x in range(1,101)])
```
