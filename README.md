# euler-problemset-sage


This [SAGEmath](https://www.sagemath.org/) Jupyter practice notebook exists as a portfolio component to demonstrate mastery to employers.

If you are solving the problems for the sake of learning and found yourself here for some reason, please refrain from simply doing copy pasta.

From the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) page:
_There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, that will rarely be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself._
