    "SAGEmath is appropriate because:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Accessibility**: Sagemath is _FOSS_ alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB; designed by and for mathematics researchers, and usable for anyone who knows python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ease of Use**:\n",
    "   - [Linux installation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/linux.html#sec-gnu-linux) is super easy on Linux since Python and TeX come prepackaged in many distros. Windows and Mac simple installation also available too.\n",
    "   - [Jupyter integration] as demonstrated in this project. \n",
    "   - [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/features/sage) allows for collaborative computational work (freemium).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Highly Optimized**: \"SageMath allows those students who are more interested in math than `malloc()` to spend more time thinking about math and less time figuring out why their code segfaults.\"\n"
